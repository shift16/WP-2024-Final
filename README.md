This is the final project for my Web Programming class. In this project, I used Vue 3, Express.js, and Supabase to create a fullstack web app. The app is a fitness tracking app that allows users to create and delete posts, add and remove friends, and view friends' posts. The app makes use of REST APIs to properly communicate between the client (Vue) and server (Express), and Supabase provides its own APIs for communicating with it. Also, this project makes use of JWT for (basic) session management.

The app is currently being hosted on Render.com at https://wp-2024-final.onrender.com
