# Web Programming 2024 - Inventory Manager Web App

## Todo List
1. [IN PROGRESS] Create login page
2. Create dashboard

## Bullet Journal List
* Real-time Notifications (Users should be notified of changes to inventory items)
* Access Controls (User's have different permissions on each inventory item)
* User created comments (Each inventory item can have user submitted comments applied to it)
* Integrations with UPS, USPS, Fedex and other shipping companies to show shipping times
* Inventory items will leave "trails" meaning each update made to the item (has shipped, gets delayed, is moved to different location, etc) will be recorded
* Users can have emails, passwords, etc connected to them
* Special users called Vendors can be created who can create new inventory items that were requested to be shipped [May not be implemented]
